While other workarounds disable these updates, this solution properly downloads and installs the update.

Keeping your software updated can be important for security and stability.

### Pros
You can easily update your Discord Linux install using this script rather than using a flatpak or other packaged version.

### Cons
Requires sudo permissions because we're currently moving the files to privileged locations. Might be changed later.
