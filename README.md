# Discord Magic Update for Linux
A script that magically updates your Discord linux version using the official .tar.gz download.

### Pros
You can easily update your Discord Linux install using this script rather than using a flatpak or other packaged version.

### Cons
Requires sudo permissions because we're currently moving the files to privileged locations. Might be changed later.
